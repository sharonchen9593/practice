/**
 * Two numbers represented by a linked list. Each node in the linked list is a single digit.
 * Digits are stored in reverse order so that the 1's place is at the head of the list. Write a
 * function that adds the two numbers together and returns the sum.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). 617 + 295
 * Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. 912
 *
 * Follow up: What if digits are stored in forward order
 *
 * Hints: 7, 30, 71, 95, 109
